# Some Advice

**Advice**: Take some time this week to take care of your *health*

* Do as I say, not as I do 
* I'm not so great at this myself ...
* (it's one of my biggest flaws)

.footnote[*health* = physical, mental, and spiritual.]

# Why Causality?

* Many questions we want answers to are **causal**

* When we talk about marketing, we often want to know why something happens 
  * Did demand/revenue/... change because of <something> ?
  * And by how much?

* We also care about non-casual questions (prediction, descriptive evidence)
  * But our comparative advantage should be causality

---
# Why Causality as a Marketing Analyst?

* Causality should be a marketing analyst's **comparative advantage**
  * Plenty of fields do statistics, many probably do it better
  * Few fields worry about causality and the *why* questions the way we (should) do

* We can design more effective marketing strategies if we can identify causal effects
  * Which will generate a boost in KPIs

* **Skill to acquire**: Understanding when to make causal claims and when not 
  * Your value to a future employer sky rockets if you can do this well

---
# What is Causality?

$X$ causes $Y$ if ...

* We intervene and change $X$ and nothing else
* Then $Y$ changes as a result

---
# Examples of Causal Relationships 

Obvious:

* Turning on a light switch causes a light to be on
* Fireworks raise the noise level

Not so obvious:

* TV Advertising increases product demand
* Tweets about movies increase demand for it at theatres

Remark: The **size** these effects are **much smaller** than you probably think

---
# Examples of Non-Causal Relationships 


Obvious:

* Number of people wearing shorts at the beach and icecream consumption
* Roosters crowing followed by sunrise

Some not so obvious:

* School vending machines and obesity
* Search engine advertising and revenue (in the short term!)

# Correlation is not Causation

# Why Correlation is not Causation

(Some) possible reasons **A** might not cause **B**:

* **The opposite is true**
  * **B** actually causes **A**
* The two are correlated, but **there's more to it**: 
  * **A** and **B** are correlated, but they're actually caused by **C**
* There's **another variable involved**: 
  * **A** does cause **B** as long as **D** happens
* There is a **"chain" reaction**: 
  * A causes **E**, which leads **E** to cause **B** 
  * ... but you only saw that **A** causes **B** from your own eyes
* It's due to **chance**

# The Difficulty of Causal Inference

**Can we tell when correlation $\implies$ causation?** 

* Answer 1: It's *hard*
* Answer 2: It is possible, but we *need assumptions*

What kind of assumptions?

* "What would have beens" - i.e. (approximate) counterfactual outcomes
* "As good as random" - i.e. no selection on unobservables 
  * Known as "conditional independence"
  * Intuition: Given some control variables, differences in variable we care about are only due to randomness
    * No unobserved factors driving variation in variable of interest 

Even then: 

* At *best* we'll estimate an **average causal effect**

---
# Regression and Causality

.center[Regression assumptions on their own] 

$$
\neq \quad \text{ causal interpretations of } \beta
$$

* **Regression assumptions**: Unbiasedness, Variance of estimates 
* "**Marketing Analytics assumptions**": Can an unbiased estimate be intrepreted causally
  1. Valid counterfactual outcomes
  2. Conditional independence 

Note: Cannot test these assumptions 'statistically'

---
# Experiments in Marketing Analytics

Recent trend: use 'experiments' to estimate causal effects 

* Why? Clear counterfactual outcomes, reasonable to assume conditional independence

Experiments in Marketing!? 

Yes. Two kinds ...

* Randomized Control Trial (RCT)
  * Researcher randomly assigns observational units to treatment group, control group 
* Natural Experiments / Quasi-Experiments
  * "Nature" divides population into treatment and control in a way that is "as good as random"

Both approaches: Compare changes over time between groups

* How? ... that's what is coming next
